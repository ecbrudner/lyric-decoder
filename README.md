## Description

We created this app for users who are interested in learning more about the lyrics to the songs they are listening to, particularly the definitions of slang terms used in popular music. In creating this app, we gained a lot of valuable experience with utilizing server-side APIs to populate our app with data, and learned how to effectively style our page using Tailwind CSS. Additionally, we learned about collaboration in GitHub.

## Usage

User can enter the name of a song and the lyrics and album art for that song will be displayed. Then, the user can either copy/paste a word from the lyrics or type one in to get the Urban Dictionary definitions of that word. Any time the user searches a song or a word, that search will be saved and a button will be generated. If they want to return to that search, they can just click the button.
